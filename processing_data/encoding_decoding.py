# HTML Entities #
# Another way of encoding is html mnemonic symbols (–º–Ω–µ–º–æ–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª—ã, —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª—ã-–º–Ω–µ–º–æ–Ω–∏–∫–∏).
# (Especially if you're working with web apps)

print("unescape by code:", html.unescape("&#233")) # by code
print("unescape by name:", html.unescape("&eacute;")) # by name
print("from dict by name:", html.entities.html5["eacute;"]) # from a dict; only by name

# from python unicode symbol to html entity:
char = "\u00e9"
dec_value = ord(char)
print(html.entities.codepoint2name[dec_value])

# or by encode+decode (easier way):
place = "caf\u00e9"

# Normalization #
# case: we have two √©'s - e with acute and default e, with added combining acute
# in comparison, they will be different. we can fix that with function
# unicodedata.normalize("NFC", symbol); "NFC" stands for "normal form, composed"
# (–Ω–æ—Ä–º–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞, —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–Ω–æ–π —Å–∏–º–≤–æ–ª)

print(eacute, eacute_combined) # look same

# how to fix:
import unicodedata
eacute_normalized = unicodedata.normalize("NFC", eacute_combined)
print("normalized:", eacute_normalized)
print(len(eacute_normalized)) # 1
print(eacute == eacute_normalized)
print(unicodedata.name(eacute_normalized))
